## Example Entry

[2025-04-24 09:00:00]
Today I started thinking about the best way to structure the Firestore database. The PM wants audit logs, which could complicate things. Feeling both excited and a bit anxious about the scale of this project.

Started backend setup and documentation work per projectX.md, BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md, and README.md. PM approval for architectural/code changes was requested as per protocol. Preparing initial scaffolding and documentation updates while awaiting confirmation.

[2025-04-24 22:19:45]
Began high-priority backend implementation: Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google sign-in, password reset) and Firestore user data model (users collection, roles, security rules). Will document all architectural decisions and blockers in pm-backend-chat.md and diary-backend.md, and push changes regularly as instructed.

[2025-04-24 23:13:53]
All blockers, progress, and architectural decisions are being logged in both diary-backend.md and pm-backend-chat.md as required. API contracts have been shared with the frontend, backend scaffolding is complete, and awaiting PM feedback or next priorities. Will continue to update both files as work progresses.
