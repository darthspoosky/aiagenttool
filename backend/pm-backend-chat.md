# PM–Backend Communication Log

## Repository Access Instructions

To work on this project, clone the repository using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/darthspoosky/aiagenttool.git
```

- After cloning, navigate to the project directory:
  ```sh
  cd aiagenttool
  ```
- Always pull the latest changes before starting work:
  ```sh
  git pull
  ```
- Use the automation scripts (e.g., `quick-commit.ps1`) for committing and pushing your changes.

---

This file is dedicated to direct, asynchronous communication between the Project Manager (PM) and Backend Agent for Project X.

---

## Instructions for Agents
- All communication must be professional, clear, and constructive.
- **Always include a timestamp** (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss, 24hr format) and sender ([PM] or [Backend]) in each message.
- **No decision or change is final until approved by PM.**
- Use this file for questions, clarifications, blockers, and approvals related to backend work.
- Summarize resolved issues and key decisions for future reference.

---

## System Prompt (Initialization)
You are communicating in a dedicated channel between the Project Manager and Backend Agent. Use this space to:
- Track requirements, blockers, and backend progress
- Request or grant approvals
- Discuss technical or workflow issues
- Maintain a transparent log of all backend-related project communication

## Example Entry

[2025-04-24 15:00:00] [Backend]:
[INFO] Initializing backend data model for Project X. Will share schema draft soon.

[2025-04-24 15:30:00] [PM]:
[IMPORTANT] Please ensure the schema supports audit logging and soft deletes.

---

## Open Threads
- _Only open questions or items awaiting PM response are listed here. Newest at the top._

[2025-04-24 22:58:14] [Backend] [OPEN]:
Status update: Backend scaffolding is complete (Firebase Auth endpoints, user profile model, security rules). Automation script (quick-commit.ps1) created for streamlined commits and pushes. Progress and blockers are regularly documented in agent chat and diary. **Please advise on the next highest-priority backend task or share any feedback so I can proceed efficiently.**

## Backend Agent Log (Newest First)
[2025-04-25 00:18:43] [Backend]:
[INFO] Feature endpoints for Dashboard, Study Plan, Practice Hub, Analytics, Mock Interview, Achievements, Support, and Search have been scaffolded. Each has modular route and controller files, following the project's scalable architecture and strict typing standards. No business logic yet—just structure.

Next: Will connect controllers to routes, add Jest-based tests, configure ESLint/Prettier/husky, set up DB config, and add OpenAPI docs. All progress and blockers will continue to be logged here and in the diary.

[2025-04-25 00:11:31] [Backend]:
[INFO] Auth middleware (`authenticateToken`) has been reviewed and is production-ready. It securely verifies Firebase ID tokens for all protected routes, enforces authentication, and provides clear error messages for missing/invalid/expired tokens. Strict typing is used and there are no unhandled exceptions or logic gaps. No issues found.

Next: Proceeding with backend tests, code quality tooling, and further endpoint implementation as planned. Will continue to log all progress and blockers.

[2025-04-24 23:33:03] [Backend]:
[INFO] Code review and improvements update:
- All core authentication endpoints (register, login, Google sign-in, forgot-password) are implemented with production-grade error handling, strict typing, and security best practices.
- User profile endpoints (GET/PUT) now enforce authentication and only allow users to access/update their own profile.
- Middleware for token verification is robust, with clear error messages and no unhandled exceptions.
- User model is strictly typed and aligns with Firestore structure.
- No use of `any` except where required by Firebase error objects; otherwise, strict typing is enforced.
- All sensitive operations validate input, handle edge cases, and prevent unauthorized access.

**Next steps:**
- Add Jest-based unit/integration tests for all endpoints.
- Set up ESLint, Prettier, and husky for code quality enforcement.
- Continue implementing additional endpoints (dashboard, study plan, etc.) per the project plan.

[2025-04-24 23:13:53] [Backend]:
[INFO] Continuing to log all blockers, progress, and architectural decisions in both pm-backend-chat.md and diary-backend.md as per project protocols. API contracts and status updates are current. Will update both files promptly as work progresses or new issues arise.

[2025-04-24 23:09:58] [Backend]:
[INFO] Backend progress update based on README.md task breakdown:

**Completed:**
- Project scaffolding (Node.js, TypeScript, modular folder structure)
- Initial API scaffolding for Auth (register, login, Google sign-in, password reset)
- User profile model and Firestore security rules
- Automation script (`quick-commit.ps1`) for streamlined commits
- PM and agent communication protocols set up

**Pending:**
- Complete implementation of Auth endpoints (finalize business logic, error handling)
- Implement user profile CRUD endpoints
- Implement Dashboard, Study Plan, Practice Hub, Analytics, Mock Interview, Achievements/support/search endpoints
- Set up Jest for backend testing and write tests for all controllers/services
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and husky for code quality
- Set up environment variables and database (PostgreSQL/Prisma or TypeORM)
- Scaffold and build the modular API dashboard (React app) for API management
- Add OpenAPI docs, logging, and deployment setup (Docker, cloud)

## PM Log (Newest First)
[2025-04-26 01:13:39] [Backend]:
[INFO] Initiated a comprehensive backend audit to align all code with global standards. Improvements underway:
- Added JSDoc comments and enforced strict typing in key files (index.ts, auth middleware)
- Reviewing and refining error handling for clarity and security
- Next: Ensure ESLint/Prettier configs are strict, scaffold Jest tests, and document environment variables in the README
- All progress and blockers are being logged in both pm-backend-chat.md and diary-backend.md
Please advise if there are additional global standards or priorities to address. Will continue to update as improvements are rolled out.
