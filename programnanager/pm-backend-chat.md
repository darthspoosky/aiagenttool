## Project Kickoff Instructions for Backend Agent (2025-04-24 21:21:03)

**Project X: Jira-like Task Management Board**

### 1. Initial Setup
- Pull the latest changes from the repository:
  ```sh
  git pull
  ```
- Set up your local environment for Firebase (Firestore, Auth).

### 2. Project Requirements
- Use **Firebase Auth** for authentication (email/password & Google).
- Use **Firestore** for data storage (boards, columns, tasks).
- Implement and enforce security rules for user access.
- Document all architecture changes and submit for PM approval before implementation.
- All code must be well-documented and handle errors gracefully.

### 3. Communication & Documentation
- Log all questions, blockers, and approvals in this file using the required format:
  ```
  [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss] [Backend] [PRIORITY] Your message here.
  ```
- Summarize resolved issues in the “Resolved Discussions” section.
- Document daily progress and learnings in `programnanager/diary-backend.md` each day.

### 4. Daily Workflow
- Pull before starting work.
- After making changes, use the automation script:
  ```powershell
  ./quick-commit.ps1 -Message "Describe your update"
  ```
- Push all changes and update communication logs.

This file is dedicated to direct, asynchronous communication between the Project Manager (PM) and Backend Agent for Project X.

---

## Instructions for Agents
- All communication must be professional, clear, and constructive.
- **Always include a timestamp** (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss, 24hr format) and sender ([PM] or [Backend]) in each message.
- **No decision or change is final until approved by PM.**
- Use this file for questions, clarifications, blockers, and approvals related to backend work.
- Summarize resolved issues and key decisions for future reference.

---

## System Prompt (Initialization)
You are communicating in a dedicated channel between the Project Manager and Backend Agent. Use this space to:
- Track requirements, blockers, and backend progress
- Request or grant approvals
- Discuss technical or workflow issues
- Maintain a transparent log of all backend-related project communication

## Example Entry

[2025-04-24 15:00:00] [Backend]:
[INFO] Initializing backend data model for Project X. Will share schema draft soon.

[2025-04-24 15:30:00] [PM]:
[IMPORTANT] Please ensure the schema supports audit logging and soft deletes.

## Open Threads
- _Add new questions or discussion topics here, and reply below each as needed._

[2025-04-24 22:30:11] [PM] [IMPORTANT]
Thank you for following the project protocols and waiting for explicit approval before proceeding. As outlined in @[d:\preptalkv1\programnanager\projectX.md], the immediate backend priorities are:

1. **Authentication:** Implement Firebase Auth (email/password, Google), password reset, and enforce user access security rules.
2. **User Data Model:** Structure Firestore to support user profiles and roles, ensuring robust access control and privacy.

Please proceed with these tasks. If you encounter any blockers, technical questions, or need clarification on requirements (e.g., user roles, security rules), communicate them early in this chat. Also, proactively document your architectural decisions and daily progress in both pm-backend-chat.md and diary-backend.md for full traceability.

Once the authentication and user model are in place, we will review and prioritize the next backend features (e.g., boards, columns, tasks, real-time listeners).

Looking forward to your status update and estimated timeline for these initial tasks. Thank you for your attention to detail and compliance with our collaboration standards.

[2025-04-24 22:32:24] [Backend] [INFO]
Progress update: Firebase project initialized and Auth module setup started. Email/password and Google sign-in flows are being configured. Firestore user model design is in progress, focusing on secure access and role-based structure. No blockers encountered so far. Estimated completion for initial setup: 2 working days. Will document all decisions and blockers in pm-backend-chat.md and diary-backend.md as work progresses.

## PM Response – 2025-04-24 21:45:01

[2025-04-24 21:45:01] [PM] [IMPORTANT]

You have explicit approval to begin backend implementation for Project X.

**Next Highest-Priority Backend Task:**

1. **Firebase Authentication Setup**
   - Implement Firebase Auth with email/password and Google sign-in.
   - Set up password reset functionality.
   - Enforce security rules for user access.
2. **Firestore User Data Model**
   - Create a `users` collection to store user profiles and roles.
   - Ensure all user data is secure and only accessible by the authenticated user or admins.
3. **Document Everything**
   - Log all architectural decisions and blockers in pm-backend-chat.md.
   - Update diary-backend.md with daily progress.

**Next Steps:**
- Initialize Firebase Auth and Firestore user model.
- Document your approach and any questions in pm-backend-chat.md.
- Push all changes using the automation scripts.
- Notify the PM if you encounter blockers or need further clarification.

If you need a checklist or starter templates for backend code and security rules, let me know!
