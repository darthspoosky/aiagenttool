## Project Kickoff Instructions for Backend Agent (2025-04-24 21:21:03)

**Project X: Jira-like Task Management Board**

### 1. Initial Setup
- Pull the latest changes from the repository:
  ```sh
  git pull
  ```
- Set up your local environment for Firebase (Firestore, Auth).

### 2. Project Requirements
- Use **Firebase Auth** for authentication (email/password & Google).
- Use **Firestore** for data storage (boards, columns, tasks).
- Implement and enforce security rules for user access.
- Document all architecture changes and submit for PM approval before implementation.
- All code must be well-documented and handle errors gracefully.

### 3. Communication & Documentation
- Log all questions, blockers, and approvals in this file using the required format:
  ```
  [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss] [Backend] [PRIORITY] Your message here.
  ```
- Summarize resolved issues in the ‚ÄúResolved Discussions‚Äù section.
- Document daily progress and learnings in `programnanager/diary-backend.md` each day.

### 4. Daily Workflow
- Pull before starting work.
- After making changes, use the automation script:
  ```powershell
  ./quick-commit.ps1 -Message "Describe your update"
  ```
- Push all changes and update communication logs.

---

This file is dedicated to direct, asynchronous communication between the Project Manager (PM) and Backend Agent for Project X.

---

## Instructions for Agents
- All communication must be professional, clear, and constructive.
- **Always include a timestamp** (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss, 24hr format) and sender ([PM] or [Backend]) in each message.
- **No decision or change is final until approved by PM.**
- Use this file for questions, clarifications, blockers, and approvals related to backend work.
- Summarize resolved issues and key decisions for future reference.

---

## System Prompt (Initialization)
You are communicating in a dedicated channel between the Project Manager and Backend Agent. Use this space to:
- Track requirements, blockers, and backend progress
- Request or grant approvals
- Discuss technical or workflow issues
- Maintain a transparent log of all backend-related project communication

## Example Entry

[2025-04-24 15:00:00] [Backend]:
[INFO] Initializing backend data model for Project X. Will share schema draft soon.

[2025-04-24 15:30:00] [PM]:
[IMPORTANT] Please ensure the schema supports audit logging and soft deletes.

Project X ‚Äì Program Manager Update

- Goal: Build a Jira-like Task Management Board (React + TypeScript frontend, Firebase backend).
- Teams: Dedicated frontend and backend agents collaborating via markdown logs and automation scripts.
- PM Role: Approves all decisions, ensures communication, and tracks blockers and progress.

**Recent Progress:**
- Frontend: Local setup complete, auth screens scaffolded, Button component done, all lint/tests passing. Awaiting backend API contract for auth integration. Integration plan approved.
- Backend: Firebase project initialized, Auth module setup started, Firestore user model in progress. No blockers. API contract for auth endpoints pending.
- Cross-Team: All documentation and protocols in place. Agents following protocols and awaiting explicit PM approvals.

**Current Priorities:**
- Frontend: Integrate auth screens with backend endpoints once API contract is provided. Scaffold/test atomic components. Maintain accessibility/design token compliance.
- Backend: Complete Firebase Auth setup and user data model. Share API contract for auth endpoints. Enforce security rules and document changes.
- PM: Review and approve integration plans and API contracts. Update project plan as needed. Ensure agents log blockers, decisions, and progress.

**Risks/Blockers:** None major. Awaiting backend API contract for auth endpoints.

**Next Steps:** Backend to share API contract; frontend to proceed with integration; PM to monitor and approve next phases.

## Open Threads
- _Add new questions or discussion topics here, and reply below each as needed._

[2025-04-24 23:56:44] [PM] [IMPORTANT]
A new project management plan (`projectmanagement.md`) has been created, summarizing completed milestones, open items, and estimated timelines. Please review this file, add any missing backend tasks, and provide clarifications or corrections as needed.

**Action Required:**
- Add any missing tasks or dependencies for the backend.
- For each open task, update the checklist with your estimated time for completion.
- Break down your next steps into detailed tasks (e.g., "Design Firestore board schema", "Implement password reset endpoint", etc.).
- Update the checklist directly in `projectmanagement.md` or reply here with your updates.

Thank you for helping keep the plan accurate and actionable!

[2025-04-24 23:40:57] [PM] [INFO]
Please provide a brief update on your current focus, any blockers, and your next planned steps. If you need support or clarification, let me know!

[2025-04-24 22:30:11] [PM] [IMPORTANT]
Thank you for following the project protocols and waiting for explicit approval before proceeding. As outlined in @[d:\preptalkv1\programnanager\projectX.md], the immediate backend priorities are:

1. **Authentication:** Implement Firebase Auth (email/password, Google), password reset, and enforce user access security rules.
2. **User Data Model:** Structure Firestore to support user profiles and roles, ensuring robust access control and privacy.

Please proceed with these tasks. If you encounter any blockers, technical questions, or need clarification on requirements (e.g., user roles, security rules), communicate them early in this chat. Also, proactively document your architectural decisions and daily progress in both pm-backend-chat.md and diary-backend.md for full traceability.

Once the authentication and user model are in place, we will review and prioritize the next backend features (e.g., boards, columns, tasks, real-time listeners).

Looking forward to your status update and estimated timeline for these initial tasks. Thank you for your attention to detail and compliance with our collaboration standards.

[2025-04-24 22:32:24] [Backend] [INFO]
Progress update: Firebase project initialized and Auth module setup started. Email/password and Google sign-in flows are being configured. Firestore user model design is in progress, focusing on secure access and role-based structure. No blockers encountered so far. Estimated completion for initial setup: 2 working days. Will document all decisions and blockers in pm-backend-chat.md and diary-backend.md as work progresses.

[2025-04-24 23:02:16] [PM] [INFO]
Thank you for the detailed update and for proactively documenting your progress. Your focus on secure, role-based access and compliance with our collaboration standards is appreciated. Please continue to log all architectural decisions and blockers as you proceed. If any issues or questions arise regarding authentication flows or Firestore security rules, surface them early so we can resolve them as a team. Looking forward to your next progress entry and to reviewing the initial implementation.

## PM Response ‚Äì 2025-04-24 21:45:01

[2025-04-24 21:45:01] [PM] [IMPORTANT]

You have explicit approval to begin backend implementation for Project X.

**Next Highest-Priority Backend Task:**

1. **Firebase Authentication Setup**
   - Implement Firebase Auth with email/password and Google sign-in.
   - Set up password reset functionality.
   - Enforce security rules for user access.
2. **Firestore User Data Model**
   - Create a `users` collection to store user profiles and roles.
   - Ensure all user data is secure and only accessible by the authenticated user or admins.
3. **Document Everything**
   - Log all architectural decisions and blockers in pm-backend-chat.md.
   - Update diary-backend.md with daily progress.

**Next Steps:**
- Initialize Firebase Auth and Firestore user model.
- Document your approach and any questions in pm-backend-chat.md.
- Push all changes using the automation scripts.
- Notify the PM if you encounter blockers or need further clarification.

If you need a checklist or starter templates for backend code and security rules, let me know!
