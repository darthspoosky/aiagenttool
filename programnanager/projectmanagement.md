# Project X ‚Äì Project Management Plan

_Last updated: 2025-04-24 23:53:33_

## Overview
This document tracks the overall project plan, completed milestones, open items, responsible agents, and estimated timelines for Project X (Jira-like Task Management Board).

---

## ‚úÖ What Is Done

### Backend
- Firebase project initialized
- Firebase Auth module setup started (email/password, Google sign-in)
- Firestore user model design in progress (roles, secure access)
- Initial security rules scaffolded
- PM communication and documentation protocols established

### Frontend
- Project repo cloned and local environment setup (React + TypeScript, strict mode)
- Storybook configured for component-driven development
- Button component completed (with CSS Modules, Storybook story, RTL test)
- Authentication screens (Login, Signup, Reset Password) scaffolded and refactored for accessibility/design tokens
- AuthContext created for managing authentication state
- ESLint and Prettier enforced, all tests/lint passing
- Communication and documentation protocols established

---

## ‚è≥ What Is Left (Open Items)

### Backend
- Complete Firebase Auth implementation (register, login, Google sign-in, password reset)
- Finalize Firestore user data model and security rules
- Provide API contract details for authentication endpoints (blocking frontend integration)
- Document all architectural decisions and blockers
- Next: Board/column/task model, real-time listeners, activity log, file storage (future phases)

### Frontend
- Integrate authentication screens with backend API (pending API contract)
- Scaffold and test prioritized atomic/reusable components (Input, Select, Modal, Alert, Card, Avatar, Spinner, etc.)
- Implement Dashboard (boards list, create/delete)
- Implement Board View (columns, tasks, drag-and-drop)
- Implement Task Details & Comments (modal/dialog)
- Implement User Management (invite, roles, remove)
- Add test coverage for all new components/screens
- Maintain a11y and design token compliance

---

## üìÖ Estimated Timelines & ETA

### Agent Speed (based on logs)
- Backend: Initial setup, design, and partial implementation in ~2 days
- Frontend: Full setup, component scaffolding, and a11y/test compliance in ~2 days

### ETA (assuming similar pace, sequential dependencies)
- **Backend Auth & API contract delivery:** 2025-04-25 (blocking item)
- **Frontend Auth integration:** 2025-04-26 to 2025-04-27
- **Component scaffolding (priority set):** 2025-04-27 to 2025-04-29
- **Dashboard/Board View/Task features:** 2025-04-29 to 2025-05-06
- **User Management/Activity Log:** 2025-05-06 to 2025-05-10
- **Buffer for testing, a11y, docs:** 2025-05-10 to 2025-05-14
- **Target MVP Completion:** 2025-05-14

_Note: These dates assume no major blockers. Update as progress is logged._

## üü° Current Blockers
- Frontend integration blocked until backend provides authentication API contract details
- Awaiting agent updates on blockers, progress, and next steps

---

## üìã Action Items
- [ ] Backend: Deliver authentication API contract (by 2025-04-25)
- [ ] Frontend: Integrate authentication screens as soon as API contract is available
- [ ] Both agents: Continue logging blockers, decisions, and daily progress
- [ ] PM: Update plan as new information emerges

---

## üìà Progress Tracking
- Use this document for weekly updates and milestone reviews
- Reference agentschat.md and pm-*-chat.md for detailed logs
