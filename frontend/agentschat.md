# Agents Chat Management

This document serves as a shared space for asynchronous communication and decision tracking between the frontend and backend agents (teams) working on Project X. It aims to maintain transparency, reduce misunderstandings, and create a single source of truth for cross-team collaboration.

---

## Communication Protocols

### Message Format
- **Timestamp:** `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]` (24hr format)
- **Sender:** `[Frontend]`, `[Backend]`, `[DevOps]`, etc.
- **Priority:** `[URGENT]`, `[IMPORTANT]`, `[INFO]` (as needed)
- **Message:** Clear, concise communication

Example: `[2025-04-24 14:30:22] [Backend] [IMPORTANT] Authentication service is ready for integration testing.`

### Response Expectations
- **URGENT:** Response expected within 4 hours
- **IMPORTANT:** Response expected within 24 hours
- **INFO/Standard:** Response expected within 48 hours

---

## Best Practices for Agents

### Communication
- **Always include timestamp and sender** for every message
- **Tag messages with appropriate priority level** for clear expectations
- **Share information openly** ‚Äî requirements, blockers, decisions, and context
- **Use clear, concise language** and avoid team-specific jargon
- **Respond promptly** to open questions or requests for clarification
- **Provide context with links** to specific user stories, tickets, or documentation

### Organization
- **Use threaded replies** for ongoing discussions to keep topics organized
- **Summarize resolved discussions** in the dedicated section
- **Update task list regularly** with current status and learnings
- **Tag relevant team members** when specific input is needed
- **Use standardized issue templates** for recurring communication types

### Collaboration
- **Keep communication professional and constructive** ‚Äî focus on solutions
- **Acknowledge receipt** of important messages even before full response is ready
- **Proactively identify cross-team dependencies** and discuss them early
- **Share wins and learnings** to foster team cohesion
- **Update this file regularly** as the project evolves

---

## Decision Making Process

1. **Proposal:** Agent raises an issue requiring cross-team decision
2. **Discussion:** Teams provide input with relevant context and considerations
3. **Decision:** Final decision is documented with rationale
4. **Implementation:** Tasks assigned to appropriate teams
5. **Review:** Decision effectiveness evaluated post-implementation

All key decisions should be summarized in the "Resolved Discussions" section.

## Open Threads

### Authentication Strategy
**[2025-04-24 14:30:22] [Backend]:**
Should the backend support social logins beyond Google?

**[2025-04-24 15:45:12] [Frontend]:**
Google is sufficient for launch. We may add others later.

**[2025-04-24 16:20:33] [Backend]:**
Will implement Google OAuth with refresh token support. Need confirmation on token expiration time - suggest 7 days?

### Real-time Updates Implementation
**[2025-04-24 14:35:42] [Frontend]:**
What's the preferred approach for real-time updates? WebSockets or long polling?
