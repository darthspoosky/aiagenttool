## Example Entry

Started sketching the first wireframes for the board view. The PM’s focus on accessibility is a good challenge. Wondering how best to structure the CSS modules for flexibility.

Today I set up Storybook for component-driven development and created the first Button component with CSS Modules, a story, and RTL test. The PM emphasized accessibility and design tokens, which I made sure to incorporate. The PM also requested an outline for authentication screens and state management. Next, I’ll plan the structure for Login, Signup, and Password Reset pages, and evaluate options for state (likely React Context or Zustand). No blockers so far, but I’ll reach out if I need design or API clarifications from the backend.
