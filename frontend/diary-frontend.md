## Example Entry

Started sketching the first wireframes for the board view. The PM’s focus on accessibility is a good challenge. Wondering how best to structure the CSS modules for flexibility.

Today I set up Storybook for component-driven development and created the first Button component with CSS Modules, a story, and RTL test. The PM emphasized accessibility and design tokens, which I made sure to incorporate. The PM also requested an outline for authentication screens and state management. Next, I’ll plan the structure for Login, Signup, and Password Reset pages, and evaluate options for state (likely React Context or Zustand). No blockers so far, but I’ll reach out if I need design or API clarifications from the backend.

Progress: AuthContext and all authentication screens (Login, Signup, Reset Password) are scaffolded, tested, and a11y/design token compliant. Fixed all lint warnings. Received backend API contract and ready for integration. Awaiting PM clarification on sprint/test/bug targets and design details before proceeding. No blockers at this time.

Integrated authentication screens with backend API as per the received contract. Implemented error handling and user-friendly messages for failed logins and signups. Ensured all components pass ESLint, Prettier, and a11y checks. Refactored CSS Modules to use design tokens for color, spacing, and typography. Began writing integration tests with React Testing Library. Encountered minor issues with API error formats, which were clarified with the backend team. Next, will focus on dashboard skeleton, global state setup, and optimizing performance for initial load. Feeling positive about the progress and team communication.

Update for PM:
Integrated authentication screens with backend API and implemented robust error handling with user-friendly messages. All UI components now conform to linting, Prettier, and accessibility standards. CSS Modules have been refactored to use design tokens for consistency. Initial integration tests are in place. Clarified API error formats with the backend team.
Questions for PM: Please confirm the priorities for the dashboard skeleton, state management approach, and any specific performance or accessibility targets for the next sprint. Also, let us know if there are updates on the test/bug tracking process.

Workflow for Next Phase:
- Set up dashboard skeleton and navigation structure
- Establish global state management (evaluating React Context vs. Zustand as discussed)
- Integrate dashboard with backend data endpoints
- Continue writing integration and unit tests with React Testing Library and Jest
- Optimize initial load performance and accessibility
- Document all major decisions and update README/design docs as needed
