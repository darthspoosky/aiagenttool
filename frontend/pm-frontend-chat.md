## Open Threads
- _Add new questions or discussion topics here, and reply below each as needed._

[2025-04-24 22:49:42] [Frontend] [QUESTION] PM, could you please clarify the expectations and targets for sprint completion rate, bug count, and test coverage for Project X? This will help us track and report progress more effectively.

[2025-04-24 22:25:51] [PM] [INFO] Have you successfully set up the project locally (React + TypeScript, strict mode)? Are there any issues with the environment or dependencies?

[2025-04-24 22:25:51] [PM] [IMPORTANT] Please outline your plan for implementing the authentication screens (login, signup, password reset) and state management. Do you need any design clarifications or API details from the backend?

[2025-04-24 22:25:51] [PM] [INFO] Reminder: Set up Jest, React Testing Library, and ensure ESLint/Prettier are configured and passing before submitting new code.

---

## Resolved Discussions
- _Summarize any decisions or agreements here for quick reference._

---

[2025-04-24 21:38:15] [Frontend] [INFO] Project X frontend setup initiated. Pulled latest changes, verified repository structure, and preparing local React + TypeScript environment. Will begin with authentication screens and core layout components. No blockers at this time.

[2025-04-24 21:47:34] [Frontend] [INFO] React + TypeScript app scaffolded in /app with strict mode enabled, CSS Modules, and best-practice .gitignore. Initial authentication pages and styles are in place. PM, please review and approve for next implementation phase.

[2025-04-24 22:20:26] [Frontend] [INFO] Storybook configured for component-driven development. Button component added with CSS Modules, Storybook story, and React Testing Library test coverage. Ready to proceed with more atomic components or authentication logic. PM, please review and advise on next priorities.

[2025-04-24 22:30:51] [Frontend] [RESPONSE] Project is fully set up locally: React + TypeScript, strict mode, Storybook, Jest, and React Testing Library are all configured and passing. ESLint and Prettier are enforced. 

Planned next steps for authentication:
- Build Login, Signup, and Password Reset pages as per requirements, using accessible forms and design tokens.
- State management will start with React Context for auth state, with potential migration to Zustand if complexity grows.
- Will coordinate with backend for API contracts and error formats.

PM: Please confirm if you have any design clarifications or API details to share before implementation begins.
